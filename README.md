In order to adapt the "Surakarta" game on board game arena, I needed an image for the board.
I took it as an occasion to learn a bit more of SVG and try to generate raw SVG with pug template.

## How to use

```bash
npm run watch
npm run serve # in another terminal
```

(I'll check ~~later~~ never how to fix the npm package, use properly wildcards char in tasks and watch & serve in a single command)

Your browser should open on http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the board.
You can play with grid size, number of external attack paths and number of lines with pieces at the begining.

Style is all managed with few CSS properties.
